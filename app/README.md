# DESCRIPTION

Hello Guys, in this repository you will find an Angular project to demonstrate my skills.

to run the project, just clone, ensure you have npm and node installed and go to /app directory 

and run following commands:
$npm install
$npm run start

then, a server will be running into localhost:4200

Thanks by the opportunity
